# `cargo sync-readme`

**A plugin that generates a Markdown section in your README based on your Rust documentation.**

## How does this work?

Basically, this tool provides you with a simple mechanism to synchronize your front page
documentation from your `lib.rs` or `main.rs` with a place in your *readme* file. In order to do
so, this command will parse your inner documentation (i.e. `//!`) on `lib.rs` or `main.rs` and
will output it in your *readme* file at specific markers.

## The markers

Because you might want a specific *readme* file that adds some more information to the
documentation from your Rust code, this tool allows you to select a place where to put the
documentation. This is done with three markers:

  - `<!-- cargo-sync-readme -->`: that annotation must be placed in your *readme* file where you
    want the Rust documentation to be included and synchronized.
  - `<!-- cargo-sync-readme start -->`: that annotation is automatically inserted by the command
    to delimit the beginning of the synchronized documentation.
  - `<!-- cargo-sync-readme end -->`: that annotation is automatically inserted by the command
    to delimit the ending of the synchronized documentation.

**You only have to use the former marker (i.e. `<!-- cargo-sync-readme -->`).** The rest of the
markers will be handled automatically for you by the tool.

> Okay, but I want to change the place of the documentation now.

When you have already put the synchronized documentation in your *readme* but want to change its
location, all you have to do is remove everything in between the start and end annotations
(annotations included) and place the `<!-- cargo-sync-readme -->` annotation wherever you want
your synchronized documentation to appear.

## How should I use this?

First, this tool will respect what you put in your `Cargo.toml`. There is a special field called
`readme` that gives the name / path of the document you want to be used as *readme* file.
`cargo sync-readme` will operate on that file.

Once you have put the annotation in your *readme* file, just run the command without argument to
perform the synchronization:

```
cargo sync-readme
```

This will effectively update your *readme* file with the main documentation from your Rust code
(either a `lib.rs` or `main.rs`, depending on the type of your crate).

## Switches and options

The command has several options and flags you can use to customize the experience (a bit like a
Disneyland Parc experience, but less exciting).

  - `-z` or `--strip-hidden-doc`: this flag will perform a special transformation on your
    documentation when copying into the region you’ve selected in your *readme*. All
    ignored / hidden lines (the ones starting with a dash in code block in Rust doc) will simply
    be dropped. This might be wanted if you want your *readme* documentation to look like the
    one on docs.rs, where the hidden lines don’t show up.
  - `-f` or `--prefer-doc-from`: this option allows you to override the place where to get the
    documentation from. This might be wanted to override the default behavior that reads from
    the Cargo.toml manifest, the autodetection based on files or when you have both a binary
    and library setup (in which case this option is mandatory).

## Q/A and troubleshooting

### Are workspace crates supported?

Not yet! If you have ideas how the tool should behave with them, please contribute with an issue or
a PR!

### There are ugly lines starting with a dash (#) in the generated Rust code (examples)!

This is likely to be the hidden documentation feature from `rustdoc`. To fix this problem,
re-run with:

```
cargo sync-readme -z
```

<!-- cargo-sync-readme end -->
