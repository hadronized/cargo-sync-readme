 # `cargo sync-readme`

 **A plugin that generates a Markdown section in your README based on your Rust documentation.**

 ## How does this work?

 Basically, this tool provides you with a simple mechanism to synchronize your front page
 documentation from your `lib.rs` or `main.rs` with a place in your *readme* file. In order to do
 so, this command will parse your inner documentation (i.e. `//!`) on `lib.rs` or `main.rs` and will
 output it in your *readme* file at specific markers.

 ## The markers

 Because you might want a specific *readme* file that adds some more information to the documentation
 from your Rust code, this tool allows you to select a place where to put the documentation. This is
 done with three markers:

   - `<!-- cargo-sync-readme -->`: that annotation must be placed in your *readme* file where you
     want the Rust documentation to be included and synchronized.
   - `<!-- cargo-sync-readme start -->`: that annotation is automatically inserted by the command to
     delimit the beginning of the synchronized documentation.
   - `<!-- cargo-sync-readme end -->`: that annotation is automatically inserted by the command to
     delimit the ending of the synchronized documentation.

 **You only have to use the former marker (i.e. `<!-- cargo-sync-readme -->`).** The rest of the
 markers will be handled automatically for you by the tool.

 > Okay, but I want to change the place of the documentation now.

 When you have already put the synchronized documentation in your *readme* but want to change its
 location, all you have to do is remove everything in between the start and end annotations
 (annotations included) and place the `<!-- cargo-sync-readme -->` annotation wherever you want your
 synchronized documentation to appear.

 ## How should I use this?

 First, this tool will respect what you put in your `Cargo.toml`. There is a special field called
 `readme` that gives the name / path of the document you want to be used as *readme* file.
 `cargo sync-readme` will operate on that file.

 Once you have put the annotation in your *readme* file, just run the command without argument to
 perform the synchronization:

 ```
 cargo sync-readme
 ```

 This will effectively update your *readme* file with the main documentation from your Rust code
 (either a `lib.rs` or `main.rs`, depending on the type of your crate).

 ## Q/A and troubleshooting

 ### Are workspace crates supported?

 Not yet! If you have ideas how the tool should behave with them, please contribute with an issue or
 a PR!
